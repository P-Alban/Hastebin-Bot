Sharing code is a good thing, and it should be really easy to do it.
A lot of times, I want to show you something I'm seeing - and that's where we use pastebins.

Haste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

*Info*
Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view.  They may be removed earlierand without notice.

*Send me a file with your code, and I'll upload it.*
